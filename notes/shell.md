# The Spherical Shell: Why Tokens Live on the Surface

**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Context:** Analysis of token cloud geometry under the causal metric tensor

## The Puzzle

From our measurements in notebook 04.1, we found something surprising:

```
Distance Distribution (from 10,000 sampled pairs):
  Mean pairwise distance: 70.78 causal units
  Estimated diameter: 112.25 causal units
```

**Initial confusion:** If tokens are typically 70 units apart, but the whole cloud is only 112 units across, how does that work? Shouldn't the average be much smaller than the diameter?

## The Answer: High-Dimensional Geometry

The intuition breaks because we're in **1333 effective dimensions** (from the participation ratio analysis), and high-dimensional spaces behave *completely differently* from 2D or 3D.

### Key Insight: The Curse of Dimensionality (Working Backwards)

In high dimensions, almost ALL the volume of a sphere is concentrated in a thin shell near the surface. Not "most" - essentially **all** of it.

**Concrete example:** For our 1333D hypersphere with radius R = 56 causal units:
- Volume of outer 10% shell (radius 0.9R to R): **100.00%** of total volume
- Volume of inner 90% (radius 0 to 0.9R): **0.00%** (rounds to zero!)

This isn't a mistake - it's the exponential scaling of volume with dimension. When you have 1333 dimensions, the difference between r^1333 and (0.9r)^1333 is staggering.

## Working Through the Math

### Hypersphere Volume Formula

In d dimensions, the volume of a sphere with radius R is:

$$V_d(R) = \frac{\pi^{d/2}}{\Gamma(d/2 + 1)} R^d$$

Where Γ is the gamma function (generalizes factorial to non-integers).

**The key:** That R^d term means volume scales as the d-th power of radius.

### Why the Shell Contains Everything

Compare two spheres:
- **Full sphere:** radius R, volume ∝ R^d
- **Inner sphere:** radius 0.9R, volume ∝ (0.9R)^d = 0.9^d · R^d

The ratio is:
$$\frac{V_{inner}}{V_{outer}} = 0.9^d$$

For d = 1333:
$$0.9^{1333} \approx 10^{-61}$$

That's 0.000...0001 with 61 zeros. The inner sphere is effectively **nothing**.

### The Numbers

For our token cloud (R = 56 units, d = 1333):

- **Volume:** ~10^1069 cubic causal units
- **Surface area:** ~10^1070 square causal units

These numbers are absurdly large - there are only ~10^80 atoms in the observable universe. But they're consistent: surface area and volume are similar magnitude because in high dimensions, *everything is surface*.

## What This Means for Token Distributions

### Expected Distances

If tokens were uniformly distributed throughout the ball:
- Mean distance from center: 56.08 units (almost the full radius!)
- Mean pairwise distance: complicated, but around 70-80 units

If tokens were uniformly distributed **on the surface** (radius exactly R):
- Mean distance from center: 56.00 units (exactly R)
- Mean pairwise distance: R√2 = 79.37 units

### What We Observed

- Mean pairwise distance: **70.78 units**
- Diameter (maximum distance): **112.25 units** ≈ 2R

**Interpretation:** The observed mean (70.78) is between the "uniform in ball" and "uniform on surface" predictions, but **much closer to surface**.

This means tokens are concentrated near the surface of the hypersphere, with very few in the interior.

## Why This Happens: The Causal Metric

The causal metric tensor M = Cov(γ)^-1 measures distances based on the model's probability distribution. Tokens that have similar effects on next-token predictions are close under the causal metric.

**Hypothesis:** The vocabulary is "sized" to cover semantic space efficiently. Tokens spread out on a spherical shell because:

1. **Too close to center:** Redundant - multiple tokens with nearly identical effects
2. **Too far from center:** Rare or impossible combinations
3. **On the shell:** Optimal coverage of the probability distribution

The shell structure emerges naturally from the statistics of the unembedding matrix γ.

### Important: This Is NOT Due to Normalization

**Question:** Are the token vectors normalized to unit length? If so, they'd be constrained to a sphere by construction.

**Answer:** NO! Checking the L2 norms of the raw token embeddings:

```
L2 Norms (Euclidean metric):
  Min: 0.36
  Max: 1.61
  Mean: 1.09 ± 0.17
  Coefficient of variation: 15.5%
```

The vectors have substantial variation in magnitude - they're **not** normalized.

**Implication:** The spherical shell structure under the causal metric is **emergent geometric structure**, not a preprocessing artifact. The tokens naturally arrange themselves on a shell through training dynamics and the statistics of the vocabulary distribution.

This makes the finding MORE significant - it reveals something fundamental about how language models organize semantic space.

## Connection to Other Findings

### Positive Curvature (κ ≈ 26.7)

We measured positive Forman-Ricci curvature in notebook 04.2, which indicates sphere-like geometry. The shell structure confirms this - tokens literally live on a curved surface.

### Community Structure

The 4 equal-sized communities (notebook 04.3) make more sense in this context. On a spherical shell, symmetric partitioning is natural - the surface can be divided into roughly equal regions.

### Effective Dimensionality (52%)

Not all 2560 dimensions are active - only ~1333 matter. The tokens live on a 1333D submanifold (the shell) embedded in the full 2560D space.

## The "Smaller on the Outside" Intuition

Your phrase was perfect: **"smaller than it is on the inside."**

From the outside (measuring diameter): The cloud is only 112 units across - quite compact!

From the inside (living on the surface): You're on a 10^1070 dimensional surface - **incomprehensibly vast**.

This is like how the Earth's surface (2D) can feel huge when you're walking on it, even though the Earth is only ~13,000 km in diameter. Now imagine that effect raised to the 1333rd power.

## Practical Implications

### For Steering

When we add a steering vector to activations, we're not moving "into" the ball - we're moving around on or near the shell. The geometry matters:

1. **On-manifold steering:** Moves along the shell surface → stays in probability-valid region
2. **Off-manifold steering:** Moves into interior or beyond shell → leaves valid probability space

This explains "falling off the manifold" - you're literally leaving the spherical shell where tokens live.

### For Layer Selection

Comparing L2 norm vs. causal norm for steering vectors now has geometric meaning:
- **L2 norm:** Euclidean distance (treats all directions equally, ignores shell structure)
- **Causal norm:** Distance measured *along the curved surface* where tokens actually live

The causal norm should better predict steering effectiveness because it respects the geometry.

## Summary

1. Token embeddings under the causal metric live on a **spherical shell** in 1333D space
2. The shell has radius ~56 causal units, diameter ~112 units
3. Essentially 100% of the "volume" is in the outer 10% - the interior is empty
4. Observed mean pairwise distance (70.78 units) confirms surface concentration
5. This explains positive curvature, validates the manifold picture, and has practical implications for steering

The causal metric reveals the true geometry: semantic space is a curved, high-dimensional surface, not a Euclidean ball.

## Mathematical Appendix

### Shell Volume Calculation

```python
from scipy.special import gammaln
import numpy as np

d = 1333              # effective dimension
R = 56.12             # radius (half of diameter)
inner_R = 0.9 * R     # inner radius

# Log-volume to avoid overflow
log_V_outer = (d/2) * np.log(np.pi) - gammaln(d/2 + 1) + d * np.log(R)
log_V_inner = (d/2) * np.log(np.pi) - gammaln(d/2 + 1) + d * np.log(inner_R)

# Shell fraction
shell_fraction = 1 - np.exp(log_V_inner - log_V_outer)
# Result: 1.000000 (essentially 100%)
```

### Mean Pairwise Distance on Sphere Surface

For two random points uniformly distributed on a d-dimensional sphere surface, the expected Euclidean distance is:

$$\mathbb{E}[d] = R\sqrt{2}$$

This is independent of dimension! (Though the distribution around this mean changes with d.)

For R = 56.12: Expected distance = 79.37 causal units
Compare to observed: 70.78 causal units

The observed value being slightly smaller suggests tokens aren't perfectly uniform on the surface - there's some clustering (which we saw in community detection).
